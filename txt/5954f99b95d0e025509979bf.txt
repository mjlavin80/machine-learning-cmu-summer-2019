After the derailment on the A train on Tuesday, I asked riders how they felt about the New York City subway system. Just hours after the accident on Tuesday, and during commutes on Wednesday morning, they seemed unfazed — or maybe just resigned to the near-constant delays, service interruptions and safety hazards. “I don’t want to make too big a fuss about it. ... it’s the same if you take an airplane, there is always a risk with it.” — Niniane Paeffegen taking the L train to Manhattan Wednesday morning “During the rush hours the train is jam-packed ... it’s really hard, but you know, it’s part of life, you have to struggle.” — Sam Eman on the A train Tuesday with his sons Sebastian, 8, and Lorenzo, 9 months “I don’t like [the delays]. ... I just want to get to where I’m going and that’s all.” — Celeste Holder on the A train in Manhattan on Wednesday morning “This season seems to be particularly bad, right? ... I had a friend who was on that [derailed] train and it’s a little scary, I guess. I’ve heard a lot of stories of a lot of my friends getting stuck underground, even without service, and being several hours late to work, so it’s pretty brutal.” — Ricky Alexander waiting to board an A train on Tuesday “Right now it was supposed to be express, and now it’s running local, and that’s not right. In Far Rockaway, they forget us ... I think they need to do a better job.” — Maimouna Sow in Brooklyn on Tuesday
