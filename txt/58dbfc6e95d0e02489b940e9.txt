And so the divorce begins. Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May, invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, on Wednesday formally announced her country’s plan to withdraw from the European Union. Are Britain and the European Union ready to live apart? The Observer and The Guardian are not too happy about the developments: The UK will throw into jeopardy the achievements of 60 years of unparalleled European peace, security and prosperity from which it has greatly benefited. — The Observer, March 25 Leaving the European Union will weaken the remaining 27 members, and it is likely to set this country on a decade or more of instability. — The Guadian, March 28 The Telegraph suspects Europe is elated. And it commends Mrs. May for astutely reading the winds. The length of time Mrs May set from her ascendancy to triggering Article 50 proved wise. It allowed the Civil Service to prepare. It allowed the country to get over the shock of the referendum result. And it allowed the Remain militants to exhaust parliamentary obstruction. Britain is on the way to Brexit. — The Telegraph, March 29 Of course there are those, like Allister Heath of The Telegraph and the economist Patrick Minford — profiled in The Spectator in October — who think Brexit is a great thing for Britain. Mr. Minford thought Mrs. May should have pushed to leave the European Union earlier. Now all eyes are on Scotland and whether, or when, it will seek independence. According to Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland and the leader of the Scottish National Party, March 29 will be remembered as the day that the United Kingdom turned “its back on almost half a century of close cooperation with its partners on the European mainland.” Happy #BrexitDay.
