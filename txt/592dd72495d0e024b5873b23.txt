The rules for racing in the Shetland Pony Grand National are simple: You have to be between 8 and 13 years old, and shorter than five feet. That’s it. I came across a clip of children racing in the Shetland Pony Grand National on the BBC Sports website last year and immediately thought it would make a brilliant short film. It was visually amazing to watch these children racing around a track, but also entertaining: The jumps are generally only a few feet high. In the stands there were large crowds treating it as seriously as the children, who were wearing full racing silks and riding their miniature steeds at breakneck speed. The organizers granted me full access to the sporting events, which have been happening all over Britain for more than 20 years. I quickly realized that this was more than just a spectacle that had caught my eye; it’s a real steppingstone for kids to become jockeys. It is to racing what go-karting is to Formula One. It is a world full of quirky characters, not least the children themselves, who behave like adults and take their sport very seriously, but also the ponies, who are incredibly strong minded, and often naughty and aggressive. (Able to pull twice their body weight, Shetland ponies are noted for their strength but not known for their speed.) I saw some quite serious falls and collisions, and the children got up and dusted themselves off, showing no pain at all. The children travel with their ponies in large trailers all over the country, competing for the chance to race in front of the queen at the Royal Windsor Horse Show and at the Olympia in London with thousands of people cheering them on. It is a lot of fun, but also serious business, as the children are learning what it takes to become a proper jockey in a real racing environment. And they raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity. The Shetland Pony Grand National is intrinsically British. It is a joyful example of everything that is great about our culture.
