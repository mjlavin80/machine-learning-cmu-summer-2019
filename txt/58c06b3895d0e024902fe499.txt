There’s currently a bronze statue of a little girl standing in front of the charging bull on Wall Street. It really does have a great look — all the laws of mass and motion aside, you feel pretty confident the bull is going to wind up backing down. And it reminds you that while marching is important, sometimes you can make a difference by standing still. The Wall Street girl celebrates all the people who resisted by staying in place. A little bit to the north one of my all-time favorite heroines, Elizabeth Jennings Graham, won a place in history by refusing to move an inch. An African-American schoolteacher, Graham was on her way to play the organ at a church service in 1854, when her streetcar’s conductor demanded she get off and wait for a car for colored people. Unlike the little bronze girl on Wall Street, she did not stand up and put her hands on her hips, since that would have facilitated her removal. She stayed sitting, hugging the window, until she was dragged away kicking. She found a lawyer, filed a lawsuit, won the suit, and gave New York City integrated mass transportation a century before Rosa Parks held her ground. Marches are a great demonstration of solidarity: How many people will be telling their grandchildren they were at the women’s march after the Trump inauguration? But the little girl is a nice reminder that even if a crowd isn’t available, you have to do what you can. Even if it means standing down a bull, or refusing to get off a trolley.
