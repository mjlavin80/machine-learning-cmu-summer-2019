How does that help?” asks Dr. Nicholas Vasquez of Phoenix. All of these quotations come from a two-minute video in which doctors around the country explain why so many of them oppose the Senate health care bill. I encourage you to watch it. In a note accompanying the video, the doctors explain: “All physicians take an oath to do no harm. ... Today, protecting our patients means speaking out against the legislation that threatens their access to health care, their health, and their quality of life.” Nearly every major health care group opposes the bill, including the main advocacy groups for doctors, nurses, hospitals and retirees, as well as advocates for the treatment of virtually every major disease. But some of those groups haven’t fought all-out against the bill, as I’ve written before. In part, they seem to fear angering Congressional Republicans. It’s important to distinguish between the lobbying groups and their members, though. Many individual doctors, nurses and others have indeed been trying to do everything they can to keep millions of people from losing health insurance. It’s worth listening to them. It’s also worth recognizing the American College of Physicians, which represents internal-medicine specialists and which has been aggressive in its opposition to the bill. Also, in Sunday Review, my colleague Stuart Thompson and I published our attempt at a definitive list of President Trump’s public lies.
