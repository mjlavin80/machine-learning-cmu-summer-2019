NEW ORLEANS — The City of New Orleans is known for its rich history with its French and Spanish influences. Tourists flock here all year long to experience the fun, laid-back atmosphere. It is one of the more inclusive places one can visit in the United States. And the people of New Orleans are the heart, soul and spirit of the city. About 60 percent of the population is African-American. They add to the flavor of New Orleans through its art, food, language and music. Unfortunately, there are Confederate monuments sprinkled throughout the city. This week, workers finally began removing those monuments. Who wants to be reminded on a daily basis of the atrocities committed on American soil by American citizens? I’m a civil rights historian, and I know that horrible period in our history can never be undone. But what transpired does not need glorification, and it certainly does not need monuments symbolizing division, hate and racial strife. After Reconstruction many Southern states, including Louisiana, wanted to show their pride in fighting the Civil War and to maintain a legacy of white supremacy and segregation. Between 1884 and 1893, the City of New Orleans erected four monuments, three of which honored the leaders of the Confederate States of America: Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate troops; Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America; and P.G.T. Beauregard, a Confederate general. The fourth monument, an obelisk, commemorated the Battle of Liberty Place, in which black police officers were killed during a violent uprising in 1874 by the Crescent City White League, a white supremacist group opposed to the city’s biracial collaboration. This is the first monument that has been dismantled. I say good riddance. Confederate monuments should be housed in a museum. We cannot run from history, nor should we try. But as Americans we should not celebrate intolerance, division and hate. And we should move on.
